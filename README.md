# Wordle-Clone

## Description

This is a basic Wordle clone that can be used to play repeatedly insted of waiting for the official version to update it's daily word.

It was written with the aim to make it mostly HTML agnostic making all "under-the-hood" behaviour JS focused allowing for changes to the HTML without needing to refactor large swaths of code. It also separates most actions into function calls allowing for easy modification of functionality and redesigning of event handling without need to throw out or repeatedly cut and paste.

## Usage Instructions (for laymen)

**Ignore this section for now, simply opening the file woll not work. Fix is in the works**

To play simply download the latest release files and unzip them wherever, so long as they are all within the same directory the game will function. To start just open _index.html_, this will open the game in your default browser.
