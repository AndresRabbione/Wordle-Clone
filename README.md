# Wordle-Clone

## Description

This is a basic Wordle clone that can be used to play repeatedly insted of waiting for the official version to update it's daily word.

It was written with the aim to make it mostly HTML agnostic making all "under-the-hood" behaviour JS focused allowing for changes to the HTML without needing to refactor large swaths of code. It also separates most actions into function calls allowing for easy modification of functionality and redesigning of event handling without need to throw out or repeatedly cut and paste.

## For Laymen Use

The game is now hosted using [Vercel](vercel.com) at the folloing [link](https://wordle-clone-andres-rabbiones-projects.vercel.app/).
